# Compiled_Diary

Compiled_Diary is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of extracting text from various files, specifically targeting the aggregation of daily notes from applications like Obsidian into a cohesive diary format. This project aims to simplify personal knowledge management by automating the compilation of notes, making it easier for users to review and reflect on their daily insights and information collected over time.

## Getting Started

To set up a Python project for development and testing on your local machine, you can follow these standard instructions. Adjust the specifics (like the project name, required packages, or commands) to fit your project's needs.

### Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.x. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To check if Python is already installed on your system and to see its version, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

Or, if your system differentiates between Python 2 and Python 3 installations:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps your dependencies for the project separate and organized. To set up a virtual environment, navigate to your project's directory in the terminal and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This command creates a virtual environment named `venv` in your project directory. To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the project's dependencies using the `pip` command. Your project should include a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary Python packages. Install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, you should be able to run the project. Depending on how your project is structured, this step can vary. Typically, for a Python script, you can run the project with:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the path to the main script of your project. If your project is a package or module, adjust the command accordingly.

### Running Tests

If your project includes tests, you can usually run them with a test runner or framework command. For example, if you're using `pytest`, run:

```bash
pytest
```

Make sure you are in the project directory or specify the path to the tests.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

This command will return you to the global Python environment.

### Conclusion

These instructions should help you get a Python copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing. Remember to adjust commands and file names according to your project's specific setup and requirements.

Enjoy!
